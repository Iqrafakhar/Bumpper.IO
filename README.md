# Bumpper.IO
I have Created A bumpper game.
In this i have created destroy out of bounds, OncollisionEnters,MultifunctionCamera and PowerUp Scripts to add extra functionality like when the player kils an enemy then these scripts will change the size by 0.2 and texture of the player.
I have made the texture changing... in which after killing the other object the texture of the killer will be changes.
MultiFocusCamera script will have target which it will take in bound to show in screen and also zoom_in and zoom_out if the player and enemy are close to each other or far away from each other.
